# Acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-classification
**Deep learning-based approach for automated leukemia detection from blood smear images.**

This project uses **deep learning** to classify microscopic blood images for early detection of **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)** — a rapidly progressing blood cancer that affects mostly children. Traditional diagnosis is slow and error-prone, so this model aims to provide an **automated, accurate, and efficient** alternative.

##  Models Used
- **Custom CNN** – Baseline convolutional model  
- **EfficientNetB0** – Pre-trained lightweight model for high accuracy  
- **ResNetV2** – Deep residual network to capture complex features  

---

##  Highlights
- Implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Applied **data augmentation** (flips, rotations, zooms) to improve generalization  
- Compared three architectures for classification performance  
- Complete pipeline (data preprocessing, training, evaluation) in a **single notebook**
